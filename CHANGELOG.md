### Added

### Changed
-	The error display management while storing a new item in `functions/mot_tzv_events.php` function `add_event` to display a general error message if an error

	`$path_helper->get_web_root_path()` only works correctly if the 'Enable URL Rewriting' setting is set to 'Yes' which is fixed by using the `$root_path`
